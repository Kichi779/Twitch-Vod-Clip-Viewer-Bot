This software allows you to send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a proxy. The way it works is through Selenium, which enters proxy sites, types the channel name, and then reduces the stream quality to 160p. This allows you to connect to the live stream as a viewer through a proxy without having to pay for one.

- The working logic is simple. CroxyProxy is a proxy website that connects to the website you want with proxies, and this code automates the process with Selenium.

‚ö†Ô∏è it is recommended to use this software on another computer (not the one you are streaming from) or on a computer with a large amount of RAM because it opens a lot of hidden tabs in the background and can send as many viewers as you want to the stream

# üì• Installation & Usage


- Python must be installed
- If your Python is not installed, download the latest version (3.11) of python and make sure to click on the 'ADD TO PATH' during installation.

- ### Install the chromedriver version compatible with the installed version of Google Chrome on your computer. ‚ö†Ô∏è

  https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/?pli=1
  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kichi779/Twitch-Viewer-Bot kichivodviewerbot

cd kichivodviewerbot

pip install -r requirements.txt (Or you can click on install.bat file)
```
## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

- **After completing the installation process, make sure that you have successfully installed the chromedriver.**

### Chrome location
- ### chrome_path = 'D:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe' This is how the file path is set in the code. If you don't change it according to your own, the code will not work.

- **Then run the run.bat file or double click the main.py file.**


# Usage recommendations üìñ

- This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or perform this operation on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)

- If the audience delivery takes too long and sends only a few viewers, close the client and reopen it, then repeat the same steps. (Proxy sites can sometimes slow down.)
